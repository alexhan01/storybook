## 📚 동화책 | Personal Website

### 💡 why

Little corner myself on the internet. Trying to make maintaining it easier by using markdown-based content management.

### ✍ editing content

To edit textual content on the About, Education, and Experience page, it's as simple as editing the associated markdown frontmatter.

For the treemap on the Education page, edit the courses.json file.

For the images on the Experience page, since GraphQL doesn't native support dynamic queries, will have to manually edit the orgs.js file and add the images/orgs folder. 

To add additional projects, add a projectname.md file to the content/projects.

### 👀 interesting

동화책 means storybook in English where "동화" means story or fairytale and 책 means book. Interestingly, "동화" is also my korean name. It seemed like a fitting name for a personal website tracking my story.

### 🧭 future

Couple things I want to fix up:
- easier method of adding new courses to courses.json
- allowing additiong of images (incl. formatting) to the Experience page without manual labour
- removing repetitive code or styling decisions
